Things to Do :

1. Find ways to create a performance measurement solution to enable universities to measure
the quality of the education they deliver to students.
2. We need to focus on faculty and courses that contribute to the growth of graduates over a 5 yr period.
3. Figure out ways to track jobs and promotions graduates get over time and assign rankings accordingly.
4. Track courses and their relevance to graduates growth.
5. Design a dashboard that enables college and university administrators to compare performance of their
academic units.
6. Ranking system for students to decide where they want to go for studies.

Deliverables :
1. Report outlining your proposed solution
2. Sequence diagram showing how to navigate the university object model to deliver performance metrics needed for performance and feedback.
3. Class diagram showing the changes to the university model to support the new capabilities. This diagram must include the additional methods and attributes to deliver the results.

Sequence Diagrams:
1. Feedback of course sequence diagram.
2. Feedback of professor sequence diagram.
3. Course ratings by employment.
4. 


Final Thoughts:
1. Placement percentage + Avg income + Average (rating of company*no of students placed in it) ---- Education quality assesment.
2. Tracking jobs and promotions of graduates can be done by fetching data from linkedin and also from the alumni association.
3. Graduates growth based on the pay increment and company ranking increment and then mapping them to the courses.
4. Ranking system is by the Educational Quality assesment + alumni feedback + reasearch work
